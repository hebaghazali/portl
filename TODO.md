## Getting Started

1. Start with **Project Setup** to get your development environment ready
2. Move through the phases sequentially, but feel free to jump ahead if you need specific features
3. Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
4. Keep the YAML configuration simple and extensible
5. Focus on error handling early - it will save you time later

## Notes

- This project will give you hands-on experience with database connectivity, data pipelines, and CLI development
- Perfect for learning backend engineering concepts like connection pooling, batch processing, and error handling
- The modular design will help you understand system architecture and component interaction
- Consider this a stepping stone toward building more complex financial data pipelines and trading systems
